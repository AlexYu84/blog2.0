    <h1> Assignment 1 blog (April 11, 2021) </h1>
      <ul> <h2> Challenges I faced for this assignment </h2> </ul>
        <ul><p> The biggest challenged I faced while doing this assignment was publishing these newly created pages because it required a lot of steps such as connecting to the school vpn, finding where to upload it, etc... </p></ul>
      <ul><h3> What did I learn from this assignment?</li></ul>
        <ul><p> The things I learned from this assignment were the basics of using html as well as refreshing myself on how to use git and github because the last time I used it was fall term when I took CS261.</p></ul>
      <ul><h3> Helpful resourses for this assignment </ul></h3>
        <ul><p> The most helpful resourses for this assignment were definitely the pre recorded lectures that I went back and watched to get a better understanding of how to use html. There were some days I missed class and having those there were really helfup</ul></p>

    <h1> Assignment 2 blog (April 25, 2021)</h1>
      <ul><h2> Challenges about this assignment</h2></ul>
        <ul><p> The biggest challenge doing this assignment was the trial and error of trying to get everything to match the example given to us. Much of my time went into trying to trial and error</p></ul>
      <ul><h2>What did I learn from this assignment? </h2></ul>
        <ul><p> I basically learned a lot about CSS and how I sort of have some likes and dislikes about it. Some things I liked about using CSS was (if I weren't doing an assignment) I have a lot of freedom in what I can choose (colors, sizes, position, etc...). Something I didn't mind but some others might were how CSS is just trial and error until you get what you want.</p></ul>
      <ul><h2>What kinds of resources were helpful for completeing the assignment?</h2></ul>
        <ul><p>The recorded lectures were always helpful incase I forgot something but if I didn't know a specific step I needed a lot of the websites Professor Hess recommended like CSS tricks and MDN web docs were definitely of some help while doing this assignment</p></ul>
      <ul><h2> What are one or two things you had to google?</h2></ul>
        <ul><p>One thing I had to google was to find out how to get rid of text decoration. Even though it was quite simple</p></ul>

    <h1> Assignment 3 blog (May 06, 2021)</h1>
      <ul><h2>What was challenging about this assignment</h2></ul>
        <ul><p>The biggest challenge for me on this assignment was the search bar. I understood how to find the twit text or author but the issue I had was trying to delete them from the DOM. The easier way (which we weren't suppose to do) was hide them.</p></ul>
      <ul><h2>What did I learn from this assignment?</h2></ul>
        <ul><p>I learned a lot about javascript and how it functions with html. Something really nice about this language is how easy you can check you work - a lot of other languages don't even allow you to run your program when there's even a single error but this language makes that pretty simple</p></ul>
      <ul><h2>What kinds of resources were helpful for completeing the assignment?</h2></ul>
        <ul><p>Just like the last assignment, I think the most useful resources were the recorded lectures and the websites Professor Hess recommended.</p></ul>
      <ul><h2> What are one or two things you had to google?</h2></ul>
        <ul><p>One thing I had to google was example search bars but that didn't really help out all the much.</p></ul>
